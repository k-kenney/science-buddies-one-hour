HTML Developer Test
Develop a single HTML page with the following requirements:
1. Use HTML5 and CSS best practices.
2. HTML must be valid HTML5 and CSS3 and must pass validation.
3. The page must work on all modern browsers (desktop and mobile).
4. The HTML layout must be fluid.
5. Main rendering area with a width of 1000px or device width (no horizontal scroll bar should
not appear)
6. If the device's width exceeds 1000px, the rendering area should be centered horizontally.
7. A header on top using the entire rendering area’s width and height that grows/shrinks with
its content.
8. A footer at the bottom using the entire rendering area’s width and height that grows/shrinks
with its content.
9. The main content’s (between the header and footer) layout should be made of many
sections with these requirements:
a. Must support any number of sections from 1 to 100.
b. Fit as many sections in a row as possible with a maximum of three.
c. Minimum column width of 15em.
d. All sections have the same width.
e. The entire width of the rendering area must be used.
f. Sections wrap to another row when they don’t fit in a row.
g. All sections within a row are the same height (the height of the tallest section).
h. There should be a gap of 1rem between sections horizontally and vertically, but not
for the first or last section in every row and column.

Use 0.5em padding for the header, footer, and all sections in the main content. Add styles of your
choosing to each section so that it is easy to identify them on the browser.
If there are any ambiguities, select and implement the best approach for you.
Zip all resources that you developed and send us the zip file. You should include a file listing the
decisions/changes you made while developing the page. Also, include a list of the development,
debugging, and testing tools that you used. And list what browsers you tested the page on and how
you tested it.
